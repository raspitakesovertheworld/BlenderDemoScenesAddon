# Blender DemoScenes Addon

Ever started Blender and dreamed about having something more than the standard cube? 
Like a scene, being able to give that fancy GPU or CPU a spin and render it?
Then analyze it, see how masters did it? Learn from example?

I did this addon for newbies, to give them a great start. 
It includes a link for demo scenes in the help menu, giving the choice of 3 scenes:

1. Simple: BMW27
2. Medium: Pavillon Barcelone 
3. Complex: Classroom


Update: 
the addon was originally for Blender 2.79 series and is currently being reworked to work on 2.8x and later.
